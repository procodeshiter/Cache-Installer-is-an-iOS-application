Tutorial for Using the Cache Installer App

App Description:

Cache Installer is an iOS application that allows you to download files from GitHub, replace them in a specified directory on your device, and automatically restore the original file after 3 seconds. The app also includes visual effects (particle animations) and logging to help you track operations easily.

Step 1: Launching the App

Install the app on your iOS device.
Open the app. You will see an interface with:
A Cache Installer label.
A Run button.
A status label (Status: Idle).
An operations log (initially hidden).
Step 2: Setting Up the File to Download

In the app's code, locate the following line:
objective-c
Copy
NSString *fileURL = @"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repository/main/data.unity.3d";
Replace the URL with the actual link to the file you want to download.
Specify the destination path for the file replacement:
objective-c
Copy
NSString *finalPath = @"/path/to/destination/data.unity.3d";
Replace "/path/to/destination/data.unity.3d" with the path to the file you want to replace.
Step 3: Running the Process

Tap the Run button.
The app will start the process:
Download the file from GitHub.
Save it to a temporary directory.
Set file permissions.
Move the file to the specified directory.
Launch Standoff 2 (if installed).
After 3 seconds, the app will automatically restore the original file from the backup.
Step 4: Monitoring Logs

During the process, the operations log will be displayed in the text field at the bottom of the screen.
The log includes:
Timestamps for each operation.
Success or error messages.
Step 5: Completion

After the process completes, the status will change to:
Status: Success — if all operations were successful.
Status: Failed — if an error occurred.
If Standoff 2 is installed, it will launch automatically.
Additional Features:

Particle Animation: Thin lines with circles at the ends are displayed in the background, smoothly connecting and fading away.
Logging: All process steps are logged for easy debugging.
Automatic Restoration: The original file is restored 3 seconds after replacement.
Example Use Case:

You want to replace the data.unity.3d file in Standoff 2.
Specify the file's GitHub URL and the path to the file in the game.
Tap Run.
The app downloads the file, replaces it, and restores the original file after 3 seconds.
Important Notes:

Ensure the file URL and destination path are correct.
The app requires access to the file system and the internet.
To launch Standoff 2, make sure the game is installed on your device.
Conclusion:

Cache Installer is a handy tool for replacing files on iOS devices with automatic restoration and detailed logging. Use it for testing, modifying, or backing up files.
